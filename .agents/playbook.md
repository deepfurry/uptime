# Change Playbook

Repository context is authoritative; Agent Skills are optional accelerators and
must not be required to understand or safely modify the repository.

## Workflow

1. Understand the requested scope and acceptance criteria. Identify conflicts
   with current implementation or design before changing either.
2. Inspect `git status`, the current branch, `AGENTS.md`, architecture, and the
   relevant contracts. Preserve existing user changes; do not overwrite them.
3. Read affected source/tests and establish a verification baseline. Work only
   within the repository and avoid assumptions about neighboring directories.
4. Make the smallest coherent change. Avoid unrelated refactors, dependency
   upgrades, speculative abstractions, and empty packages.
5. Add behavioral tests for observable changes, including error/exit behavior.
6. Run verification, inspect the complete final diff (including new files), and
   check for unintended artifacts, dependencies, or scope expansion.
7. Update the changelog for notable changes. Add an ADR only when an important
   architectural decision is not already captured by the initial baseline.
8. Report the result and exact validation performed, including failures and
   unavailable checks. Push or publish only when explicitly requested.

## Task Routing

| Change | Read first |
| --- | --- |
| CLI, configuration, user-visible behavior | [Compatibility](../contracts/compatibility.md) |
| bbolt, history, retention, schema | [Persistence](../contracts/persistence.md) |
| Fiber, Fiber Uptime, Redis, bbolt behavior or upgrades | [Upstream](../contracts/upstream.md) |
| Architectural boundaries | [Architecture](architecture.md), relevant [design](../docs/design/), then consider an [ADR](../docs/decisions/README.md) |

## Verification

From the repository root, canonical verification is:

```sh
make check
```

It checks formatting, vets, tests, and builds packages. `make build` verifies
compilation without packaging a binary. `make fmt` applies Go formatting;
`make fmt-check`, `make vet`, `make test`, and `make build` run individual checks.
GNU Make and Go 1.26 or a supported newer Go are required. CI verifies Go 1.26.x
and 1.27.x using the same `make check` entry point.

For storage/runtime changes also run `make race`
(`go test -race ./storage/bbolt/... ./internal/app/...`).
It is separate from `make check` and has a dedicated Go 1.27.x Ubuntu CI job.
The race detector requires a supported platform and C compiler; report local
limitations rather than claiming an unavailable run passed.

If GNU Make is unavailable, equivalent Go commands are:

```sh
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go build -o /dev/null ./...
```

On Windows, use `go build -o NUL ./...` for the final command. Explicitly using
the host's null device prevents a single-main-package build from leaving an
executable in the working tree; Make selects the device automatically.

For final verification, formatting must leave no additional diff. Make applies
`gofmt` to Git-listed and unignored Go files, including new source, so local
dependency caches are not formatted. `go fmt ./...` is the package-scoped
fallback. Both formatting commands modify source; inspect their changes before
declaring the final tree verified.

When module inputs change, run `go mod tidy`, inspect `go.mod`/`go.sum`, and run
`go list -m all`. Direct dependencies are Fiber v3, Fiber Contrib Uptime, bbolt, and YAML v3;
their transitive module graph is expected. Always finish with:

```sh
git diff --check
git status --short
git diff
```

Review staged changes with `git diff --cached` when present and inspect untracked
files as well: ordinary `git diff` does not include them. CLI smoke checks are:

```sh
go run ./cmd/uptime --help
go run ./cmd/uptime version
go run ./cmd/uptime config check --config configs/uptime.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/uptime config check --help
go run ./cmd/uptime serve --help
```

Do not claim unavailable toolchain or remote CI checks passed locally. P1 tests
the public backend using real temporary database files. P2 config tests inject
environment lookup and generate temporary TLS keypairs in Go. The official example
must validate without secrets or external services; config check never starts runtime.
P3 integration tests use local `httptest.Server` targets, ephemeral listeners and
temporary bbolt, with deadline polling and context cancellation. Verify Linux and
Windows amd64 builds after lifecycle/signal changes; no release packaging is implied.
