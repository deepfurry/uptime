# Compatibility Contract

## Current Surface

The executable exposes help (`uptime`, `help`, `-h`, `--help`), version
(`version`, `--version`), `config check [--config PATH]`, and `serve [--config PATH]`.
Both configuration commands default to `./uptime.yaml` and have `-h`/`--help`.
There is no global `--config`.
Bare `config`, unexpected arguments, and unknown commands/options are usage
errors. Service/archive commands remain unimplemented.

Successful output goes to stdout; diagnostics go to stderr. Help, version, and
valid configuration return 0; usage errors return 2; invalid/unreadable YAML,
missing active env, invalid TLS, and output failures return 1. Successful config
check prints only `configuration is valid` with a newline and empty stderr.
Config failure has empty stdout and a safe `config check: <error>` diagnostic.
No configuration is dumped. See source/tests for concrete help text.

P1 adds the public `storage/bbolt` package: `Config`, `Store`, `Open`, the upstream
Store methods, and `Name`, `Ping`, `RemoveService`, `Close`. Raw database/bucket
access is private. P2's `internal/config.LoadFile` adds the product configuration
contract; it does not open storage or construct a standalone runtime.
The module is `github.com/deepfurry/uptime`; its Go baseline is 1.26. Go support
follows the active Fiber major version's supported window; CI covers 1.26.x and
1.27.x. Updating that window requires coordinated module, CI, and documentation
changes.

## YAML Configuration (P2)

The [official example](../configs/uptime.example.yaml) shows the supported keys.
The root sections are `server`, `storage`, `uptime`, `ui`, `auth`, and `endpoints`.
YAML v3 decoding is strict throughout, including inactive branches: unknown and
duplicate keys, multiple documents, wrong scalar/container types, explicit null,
and merge keys fail. Use omission for defaults and `""`/`[]`/`{}` for intentional
empty values where allowed. Ordinary correctly typed anchors/aliases are supported.

Raw YAML retains omission state separately from normalized `Config`. The loader
applies omitted-field defaults, selects active branches, substitutes allowed env
values, and parses/validates the result. Dependent endpoint defaults use the
effective parsed interval. No later runtime code needs to apply defaults or
reparse duration/URL/timezone values. URLs use `*url.URL`, durations use
`time.Duration`, retention/window use `CalendarDays`, timezone uses
`*time.Location` (with embedded tzdata), and enabled TLS carries a loaded keypair.
TLS/Auth disabled branches are nil; exactly the selected storage branch is non-nil.

### Frozen Defaults

| Field | Omitted value |
| --- | --- |
| `server.address` | `:8080` |
| `server.shutdown_timeout` | `10s` |
| `server.tls.enabled`, `auth.enabled` | `false` |
| `storage.type` | `bbolt` |
| `storage.bbolt.path` | `./data/uptime.db` |
| `storage.redis.key_prefix` | `fiber:uptime` |
| `uptime.interval` | `10s` |
| `uptime.retention`, `uptime.window` | `90d`, `30d` |
| `uptime.timezone` | `UTC` |
| `ui.path`, `ui.title` | `/uptime`, `Service Status` |
| `ui.description` | `Current service availability.` |
| `ui.footer` | `Powered by DeepFurry Uptime.` |
| `ui.favicon_url` | empty, built-in favicon |
| `ui.thresholds.green`, `ui.thresholds.yellow` | `0.999`, `0.99` |
| endpoint `name`, `method` | its literal ID, `GET` |
| endpoint `interval`, `timeout` | global interval, `min(5s, effective interval)` |
| endpoint `description`, `headers`, `expected_status_codes` | empty |

Explicit empty required values are errors, never replaced by defaults.

### Environment and Active Branches

Only `${VAR_NAME}` is substituted, with `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` names. Expansion
is one-pass; substituted values are not rescanned. Missing active variables fail;
existing empty variables substitute successfully and then face field validation.
Malformed `${...}` expressions fail. Other dollar signs remain literal, including
`$VAR`, `$(command)`, and bcrypt `$2...`; no shell/default-expression evaluation exists.

Allowed fields: server address/shutdown timeout, active TLS paths, active bbolt
path or Redis URL/prefix, uptime interval/retention/window/timezone, UI strings,
active auth username/hash, endpoint name/description/URL/interval/timeout, and
header values. Storage type, endpoint ID/method, header names, booleans, numbers,
and list/container structure cannot interpolate. Inactive TLS/Auth/storage values
are not expanded or semantically validated and do not survive normalization.

### Validation and Side Effects

| Area | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Server | host:port; numeric port 1..65535; shutdown timeout > 0 |
| TLS | enabled paths required/readable; `tls.LoadX509KeyPair` must succeed; disabled paths ignored |
| Storage | literal `bbolt` or `redis`; bbolt path non-empty; Redis URL has redis/rediss scheme and host, no fragment, and passes pinned go-redis ParseURL |
| Redis prefix | non-empty after env expansion; no leading/trailing colon or whitespace; no control characters; internal colons allowed |
| Auth | enabled username/hash required; no plaintext field or copied Fiber hash parser |
| Uptime | interval >= 1s; canonical positive integer `Nd` calendar spans without leading zeros or overflow; window <= retention; UTC/IANA/Local timezone |
| UI | clean absolute non-root path, no trailing slash, no `/livez` or `/readyz`; non-empty title; finite 0 < yellow <= green <= 1 |
| UI text | description/footer must be non-empty; omission uses DeepFurry defaults; favicon may be empty, otherwise root-relative or absolute HTTP(S) URL |
| Endpoint identity | at least one; unique literal `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}` IDs; non-empty name |
| Endpoint request | literal uppercase GET/HEAD; http/https URL with host, no userinfo/fragment, query allowed |
| Endpoint timing | interval >= 1s; 1ms <= timeout <= effective endpoint interval |
| Expected codes | unique 100..599; empty means the upstream 2xx/3xx policy |
| Headers | valid literal token names, canonicalized, case-insensitive duplicates rejected; no Host or CR/LF values |

P2 explicitly tightens the initial design's UI path handling: invalid paths are
rejected, not silently normalized. It selects stable YAML v3 instead of the
initial provisional v4 choice. The original design remains the broader roadmap.
P3 corrects description/footer explicit-empty handling: Fiber Uptime v0.2.0
would replace empty strings with its defaults, so the loader rejects them.
Empty favicon remains legal. The P3 audit also aligns endpoint timeout validation
with Fiber Uptime's 1ms minimum. P4 adds offline go-redis URL parsing and prefix
validation. URL credentials, database paths, and go-redis-supported query options
are allowed; parser errors never echo the URL. No extra Redis YAML knobs exist.

Relative bbolt and TLS paths retain process-CWD semantics, not YAML-directory
semantics. Validation only reads the YAML and active TLS files. It never makes
directories, opens/locks bbolt, resolves DNS, connects Redis, probes endpoints,
binds ports, or constructs Fiber/Uptime. Errors identify fields/categories without
printing Redis credentials, hashes, header values, secret URL queries, TLS keys,
or environment values. Do not implement config stringification or dumps.

## Standalone Runtime (P3/P4)

`serve` loads normalized configuration and accepts bbolt or Redis, plain HTTP,
and no Auth. Active server TLS or Auth fails before runtime I/O with
`TLS serving is not yet supported` or `Basic Auth is not yet supported`.
Config check still validates these branches. `rediss://` secures the outbound
Redis connection; it does not enable server HTTPS.
No host/port/storage/tls command-line overrides or fallback exist.

Serve help and normal requested SIGINT/SIGTERM/context cancellation return 0.
Invalid config, unsupported capabilities, storage open/schema/lock failures, bind
failures, unexpected Listener return (including nil), shutdown/close errors, and
output failures return 1. Usage errors return 2. Operational errors use a safe
`serve: <error>` stderr diagnostic; runtime does not dump config or secrets.
Lifecycle logging uses Fiber's official logger on stderr, with no startup banner.

| Route | Exact response |
| --- | --- |
| GET `/livez` | 200, `ok\n`, no storage/target/readiness access |
| GET `/readyz` | 200, `ready\n` iff listening readiness flag and Store.Ping succeeds; otherwise 503, `not ready\n` |

Both health routes set `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8` and
`Cache-Control: no-store`. Ping receives a one-second timeout context; bbolt's
documented blocked-I/O cancellation limits still apply. Failures expose no details
and produce no per-request error log. Target DOWN never changes readiness.
The configured `ui.path` and `<ui.path>/api/status` are upstream dashboard/API
routes. Root `/` remains 404 without a dashboard redirect. Only YAML endpoints
are monitored; no self service is manufactured.

Startup opens selected storage, completes preflight Ping, and binds before
constructing Fiber Uptime. Redis preflight has a five-second timeout with go-redis
context timeouts enabled. Failure is fatal with a safe `cannot connect Redis storage`
diagnostic; parent cancellation cleans up and returns normally unless cleanup fails.
Keep upstream's second Redis Init/Ping: failures after preflight use its recoverable
degraded behavior. Redis outages leave liveness 200 and readiness 503; readiness
returns to 200 after Ping succeeds, without restarting or switching backend.

Shutdown clears
readiness, runs Fiber shutdown/Uptime worker cancellation and waiting, drains HTTP,
then closes bbolt or the Fiber Redis handle followed by its owned go-redis client.
Timeout errors are retained: active connection I/O is forced
closed and handlers must finish before storage is released. Shutdown timeout is
not a promise to forcibly interrupt blocked storage I/O. After initialization,
operation failures follow upstream degraded behavior without automatic exit.

Selecting bbolt versus Redis only selects an active persistence source. There is
no migration, merge, dual-write, fallback, or deletion of the old backend's data.
Shared Redis persistence provides neither leader election nor distributed
scheduling: each process probes its configured endpoints independently.

Endpoint timeout must be at least 1ms and no greater than its effective interval.
Both config check and serve reject smaller values during configuration loading,
before runtime construction. Upstream constructor rejections are still converted
from panic into safe operational errors.

## Compatibility-Sensitive Boundaries

As implemented and released, preserve the semantics of:

- Public Go APIs and their lifecycle/error behavior.
- CLI commands, flags, output semantics, and exit behavior.
- Implemented YAML keys, defaults, environment interpolation, and normalization.
- `/livez`, `/readyz`, and product-exposed Uptime dashboard/API routes.
- Archive JSON formats and documented defaults.
- Persistent schema migration behavior.

This list also constrains future archive work. Concrete APIs and formats belong
in source, tests, and their specific
documentation, not duplicated here.

## Pre-1.0 Evolution

- v0.x may evolve, but prefer additive changes whenever practical.
- Patch releases (for example, v0.1.1 to v0.1.2) must not intentionally introduce
  breaking user-facing changes.
- Minor releases (for example, v0.1 to v0.2) may break compatibility before v1.0
  only intentionally, with documentation, tests, and migration guidance where
  applicable.
- Released persistent data must not become unreadable without a supported
  forward migration. Pre-1.0 status is not permission to discard user history.
